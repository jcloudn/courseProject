			<h1>My Student Lounge Rasmussen Intro</h1>

			<p> Boozhoo! Boozhoo means "Hello" in Ojibwe the language of the Ojibwe/Chippewa Indians, of which I am a member. My husband and I are both going for our Bachelor's in Computer Science and we have two daughters, 11yrs and 28 yrs old, and three cats. I
				am a stay-at-mostly-home mom (I work two days a week doing admin stuff) and I homeschool my daughter. </p>

			<p>My first experience with college was at the University of MN in the late 90's. I went for an Aerospace Engineering degree and although I didn't complete it, I still went to work in engineering for NASA and then later for the subcontractor United Space
				Alliance processing the space shuttles at Kennedy Space Center, FL. My part was determining what was damaged to the thermal control system and how to fix it. It was an AMAZING job that I had the privilege to do for 10 yrs, after which I resigned when
				my youngest daughter was born. We moved back to MN for a short time to be with my dad until he passed of cancer, then we drove back to FL and traded our car for a school bus and traveled around the country working at different horse ranches. We did
				that for 3 yrs (we did transition into an RV) until we finally moved into an apt in Cocoa Beach. It was lovely having the ocean across the street, but we returned home to MN and bought a house in New Prague. </p>
