# courseProject

In this project I created a website with 14 pages. The website is about different vegetables – and bacon. I used ThemeRoller to create three swatches. To see the swatches click the “Open” menu on the main page and go to “Veggie Pics”. When there refresh the page to see the swatch.  Click on “About” and refresh the page to see another swatch. Click on “Contact” and refresh to see the last swatch.
On the main page the navigation bar is on a panel. The rest of the pages have the nav bar at the top. The site contains a header and a footer on each page as well.
Here is the url for the site:
